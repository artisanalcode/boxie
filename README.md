Manage modern.ie VirtualBox-Appliances with Selenium-Support

This script allows to delete and create virtual Windows-Machines using Images from http://www.modern.ie for automating Browser-Testing with Selenium.

As the modern.ie-Machines refuses to run more than 30-90 Days (at least for more than an hour) we remove the machines on a regular basis and recreate the original Appliance with all changes needed to run Selenium.

Use it with your favored test runner (maybe [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) or [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org)) to automate JavaScript tests in real browsers on your own Selenium Grid. Other WebDriver language bindings (Python, Java) should work as well.

Prerequisites
=================

  * modern.ie VBox-Appliances
  * VirtualBox (tested with 4.3)
  * VirtualBox Extension Pack
  * Selenium-Hub
  * deuac.iso
  * IEDriverServer (for Selenium)
  * chromedriver (for Selenium)
  * Java JRE (for Selenium)
  * Selenium Standalone Server
  * Optional: phpVirtualBox

What it does
=================

  * Import modern.ie Appliances to VirtualBox
  * Configure VM Network-Settings
  * Configure VM RDP-Port-Setting (VRDE)
  * Configure VM Clipboard behaviour
  * Disable UAC
  * Disable Windows-Firewall
  * Rename the VM (Hostname)
  * Configures IE Protected-Mode to work with Selenium
  * Disables IE Cache
  * Install Java
  * Install Firefox
  * Install Chrome
  * Install Selenium
  * Reports via E-Mail

What it doesn't do
==================

  * Download modern.ie Appliances (can be fetched with make fetch_vms)
  * Set up VirtualBox

Getting started
===============

  * Clone this repository.
  * Download the Appliance(s) you want to use from http://www.modern.ie/ and put the extracted OVA-Files on your Server. You can use the Makefile (see below)
  * Get the Windows Java (JRE) Installer and Selenium Server Standalone (JAR) and put them beside the OVA-Files (or somewhere else).
  * Get deuac.iso (https://github.com/tka/SeleniumBox/blob/master/deuac.iso).
  * Get IEDriverServer.exe (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver) and put it in ```./Tools/selenium_conf/```.
  * Get chromedriver.exe (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) and put it in ```./Tools/selenium_conf/```.
  * Get Chrome and Firefox, place both in ```./Tools/```.
  * Edit the Selenium Config-Files (```./Tools/Selenium_conf/*/config.json```).
  * Edit ```config.sh``` so it fits your needs (see below for details).
  * Run ```mkvm.sh /path/to/your/appliance/foobar.ova```.

Fetching the Appliances
=======================

You can get a lot of the VMs (currently IE8-11 on Windows 7) using this command:

```
make fetch_vms
```

Please note: The makefile will load modern.ie Appliances for Mac. Adjust the Download-URLs if you need the Linux-Versions.

Configure
=========

Adjust ```config.sh``` to your needs. See below for details.

If you use the Makefile to get the binary files then you shouldn't have to alter the config script.

By default the Script assumes that your VirtualBox-Machines are placed in ```VMs/``` and that the script is run by the User the script is run as. All supplemental files should be placed in ```Tools/``` but you can configure different paths.

To do so simply edit ```config.sh```:

```
java_exe="jre-windows-i586.exe"
```

Filename of your Java-Installer.

```
selenium_jar="selenium-server-standalone.jar"
```

Filename of your Selenium-Server.

```
nic_bridge="eth0"
```

Name of your Network-Interface to use as bridge for your VM.

```
vm_path="VMs/"
```

Path where to put your VMs.

```
vm_mem="768"
```

Amount of memory (RAM) for Windows Vista, 7 and 8.x VMs in MB.

```
vm_mem_xp="512"
```

Amount of memory (RAM) for Windows XP VMs in MB.

```
deuac_iso="Tools/deuac.iso"
```

Path and filename for deuac.iso (a bootable CD-Image to disable UAC so we can install Java without Problems).

```
tools_path="Tools/"
```

Path to ```java_exe```, ```firefox_exe``` and ```chrome_exe``` (Location of Installers on VM-Host).

```
selenium_path="Tools/selenium_conf/"
```

Path to your Selenium-Config-Files. It's important that you keep the folder structure below this point, otherwise the config will not be copied to the VMs (or the wrong Config goes to the wrong Machines).

```
ie_cache_reg="Tools/ie_disablecache.reg"
```

Path and filename to ```ie_disablecache.reg``` (Disables Internet Explorer Cache).

```
ie_protectedmode_reg="Tools/ie_protectedmode.reg"
```

Path and filename to ```ie_protectedmode.reg``` (Enables Protected Mode for all IE Security Zones).

```
log_path=""
```

Path to the (temporary) Logfile.

```
vbox_user="${USER}"
```

Username of VirtualBox-User.

```
mailto="root@example.com"
```

E-Mail-Adress to send logfile to.

```
create_snapshot=False
```

If ```True``` a snapshot will be created after all changes have been made.

Selenium Config / Hub Hostname
==============================

The supplied Selenium-Node-Configs (see ```Tools/selenium_conf/*/config.json```) assumes the Hostname ```hubhost``` for your Selenium-Hub. So you should set up your hostfiles/DNS-Services accordingly or change ```"hubHost": "hubhost"```, in all needed ```config.json``` files.

Check out ```updateip.sh``` if you want to modify the Hostfiles (change ```nic_bridge``` if needed; be aware that the VBox-Host is expected to be your Selenium-Hub as well).

Usage
=====

To import the IE6-WinXP Appliance simply run:

```
mkvm.sh VMs/IE6\ -\ WinXP.ova
```

If you already have an IE6-WinXP-Instance - and want to recreate it - run (expects VM to be running):

```
mkvm.sh VMs/IE6\ -\ WinXP.ova --delete "IE6 - WinXP"
```

We recommend to use a CronJob to recreate the VMs on a regular basis. See ```mkvm_cronjob```. To avoid too much load on the Host we use a Wrapper-Script ```mkvm_cron.sh``` so that only one Appliance gets imported after another.

Known Problems
==============

XP-Machines doesn't set their new hostname automatically. You can use ```C:\Temp\rename.bat``` to set the correct name. Restart the VM afterwards. This is only needed if you run more than one instance of the same Appliance.

In the Spotlight
